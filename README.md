# ToDoListPart2

This page consists of many input boxes (one for each hour during office timings). Here we can write text and press save button to save all text entered in these boxes, the text will remain even if page is refreshed.

This page also contains function that sets the background colors of input boxes based on the timing. For example, if its 1 PM, all boxes from 9 AM to 12 PM will be colored red, 1 PM box will be yellow and boxes after 1 PM wil be green.
